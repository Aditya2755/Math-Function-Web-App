# Math Function Web App

Welcome to the **Math Function Web App**! This project allows users to perform a variety of mathematical operations through a web interface. The app is built using **Flask** (Python) for the backend and **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend.


## Features
- **Addition**: Add two numbers using the web interface.
- **Factorial**: Calculate the factorial of a number.
- **More Functions**: Additional mathematical operations like subtraction, multiplication, and more can be easily added to the app.
- User-friendly web interface built with **HTML/CSS**.
- Interactive behavior using **JavaScript** and **AJAX** requests.
- Simple API integration with **Flask** to handle Python math functions.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (AJAX)
- **Deployment**: Works locally or can be deployed on cloud platforms like Heroku or PythonAnywhere.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-function-web-app.git
cd math-function-web-app
```

### Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Flask Application
```bash
python app.py
```

Now, visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser to view the app.

## Usage
1. Open the web app in your browser.
2. Use the provided forms to input numbers and perform math operations.
3. View the results in real-time as the app uses AJAX to update the results without refreshing the page.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! Hereâ€™s how you can get involved:

### Python Developers:
- Add more mathematical functions in the **Flask backend** (e.g., logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc.).
  
### Frontend Developers:
- Improve the user interface with **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Add more interactive features using **JavaScript** and **AJAX**.

### Steps to Contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-math-function
   ```
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added new math function for XYZ"
   ```
5. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-math-function
   ```
6. Create a Pull Request (PR) and describe your changes.

### Contribution Ideas:
- Add math operations like division, exponentiation, square roots.
- Integrate Python libraries like **NumPy** for complex operations.
- Improve the design using **CSS**.
- Implement user authentication and profiles for saving calculations.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more math functions like trigonometry, matrices, and calculus operations.
- Introduce user authentication for personalized experiences.
- Create a history of calculations.
- Deploy the app on **Heroku** or **PythonAnywhere**.
